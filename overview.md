This document describes several guidelines, best practices, conventions and
 rules on how to write and format code in my projects.

Pretty much everyone has a different style of programming, and everyone needs to
 respect that. If I were to collaborate in your project, I would (probably) need
 to respect and follow guidelines set by yourself.

These guidelines aren't completely enforced (especially the formatting) but for
 the sake of consistency it's best to follow them.  
A lot of these guidelines and rules can be made out of existing code anyway.
